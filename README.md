# Hi, I'm Marie-Astrid Chanteloup, aka MAC :v:

I'm a cybersecurity engineer, with experience in Microsoft AD. Look me up on LinkedIn ([m-a-chanteloup](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-a-chanteloup/)) or shoot me an email ! 😉

Billingual French and English, professionnal proficiency in German

## Who am I ?
I graduated in 2022 from TELECOM Nnancy with an MSc in IT and worked since then as a sys/sec-admin on Linux and especially Microsoft Windows.

I love understanding how things work in detail and I love even more explaining those details to anyone who'll listen! I'm an avid supporter of *proper* documentation and taking my time to explain things. I must have been a teacher in an other life (or so I've been told).

I also love learning new concepts and languages (IT or other 👀). So let's talk scripting and foreign cultures.

## What can write code in ?

I script in :
- Powershell
- Python
- Bash

I can also code in :
- C/C++
- Java

## And apart from that ?
I'm a fiber artist! 🧶 Crochet, knitting, canvas, cross-stitching... I never leave the house without a projet on hand, ask me what I'm working on! 😉

## What have I already coded with ?
